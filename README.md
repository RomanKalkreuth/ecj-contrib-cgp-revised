# Revision of the ECJ CGP Contrib Package

This is a revised version of the Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) extension package for the Java Evolutionary Computation Toolkit (ECJ). It extends the origial package written by David Oranchak. This revised version aims on the integration of advanced methods for CGP into ECJ. It will be integrated into the ECJ main line on an ongoing basis.

CGP is a heuristic method inspired by neo-Darwinian evolution for evolving graphs. CGP is known for its application to Boolean program synthesis and evolvable hardware. 

## Advanced genetic operators

- Block crossover 
- Subgraph crossover 

- Single active gene mutation
- Insertion and deletion node mutation
- Inversion and duplication gene mutation

## Requirements

- ECJ Version >= 27
